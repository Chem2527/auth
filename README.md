#  IAM, SSO, and MFA – Simple Guide with Examples

This guide explains three important security concepts in a simple way:
- IAM (Identity and Access Management)
- SSO (Single Sign-On)
- MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication)

##  IAM (Identity and Access Management)

**What is it?**  
IAM is a system that makes sure **the right people** can access **the right resources**.

-  **Who you are**  
- **What you're allowed to do**

**Why It Matters:**
- Protects sensitive data  
- Controls who can log in to systems  
- Keeps attackers out

**Real-World Example:**
You log into your **school portal**:
- You can **see your own marks**
- You **can’t** see other students’ marks

IAM checks:
- Who you are: A student
- What you're allowed to do: View only your grades

##  SSO (Single Sign-On)

**What is it?**  
SSO lets you **log in once** and access **multiple apps** without logging in again.

**Why It Matters:**
- Saves time  
- Better user experience  
- Fewer passwords = fewer security risks

**Real-World Example:**
You log into your **Google Account**. Now you can use:
-  Gmail  
-  YouTube  
-  Google Drive  
All without logging in again.

##  MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication)

**What is it?**  
MFA means using **two or more ways** to prove who you are when logging in.

**Common Factors:**
- **Something you know** → e.g. your password or card details  
- **Something you have** → e.g. your phone to get an OTP  
- **Something you are** → e.g. fingerprint or face scan

**Why It Matters:**
- Adds extra security  
- Even if someone steals your password, they can’t log in without the second step

**Real-World Example:**
You buy something on **Amazon**:
1. You enter your **credit card number**  
2. You get an **OTP on your phone** to confirm the payment
